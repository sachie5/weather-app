## Overview - Frontend Project Spec

### Goals

- Using the users location to customise their experience is a very common skill required in a lot of different contexts, this is your chance to get familiar with it!

### Specifications

**Stage 1**

- Create a React application that when run, uses the users browser location to pinpoint their position.
- This data (coordinates) will then be def into this api to get the weather data for their
  specific location
- https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx
- You will need to make an account to get an API key (this api key should be stored
  in environment variables before committing/pushing to GitHub
- The data that comes back from the weather api will then be displayed to the user on the
  screen, alongside a greeting message that changes depending on the time of the day.

**Stage 2**

- This is where you get creative
- This project could turn into a little helper for the user in the morning that shows them things like...
- Weather in their area (done in stage 1)
- How long it will take them to get to work (Google maps api variant)
- A todo list for the day
- Local news
- Any other cool features you can think of that demonstrate your React capabilities!

**Stage 3**

- Once finished, ensure the latest code is pushed to github and deployed (via gh pages, firebase, GCP or other)
  Place particular importance on your coding standards hereâ€¦
- Readable SCSS (BEM!)
- Container/Component architecture
- Good, descriptive, meaningfu commit messages
- Well sized components
- As well as focussing on the UI, take inspiration from dribbble or elsewhere to ensure it looks amazing, as well as works as intended!
